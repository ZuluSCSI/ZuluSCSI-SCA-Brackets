## Bracket for ZuluSCSI with 3.5" hard drive holes
### Designed Specifically to align the SCA connector on the ZuluSCSI Wide SCA board, but can be used with other ZuluSCSI boards

These are FreeCAD designs made for 3D printing and include the STL files for
the left and right bracket. Both brackets are have labels SCSI and SD
which correspond to the orientation of the ZuluSCSI. SCSI label should be 
closest the SCA connector side or any other SCSI connector. The SD label
should be closest to the SD Card side of the board.

When screwing in the ZuluSCSI Wide SCA, the IC chips of the circuit board
on the same side as the screw heads with the SCA connector below.

The screws holes for the hard drive mounts are standard 3.5" HDDs screws (6-32 UNC).
The screws holes for mounting the ZuluSCSI on the brackets are for 4-40 UNC 1/4 inch screws,
the closes metric version is a M3 screw 6mm in length.

There is also an alignment bracket which slides into the bottom hard drive screw holes
making it easier to screw on the left and right brackets to the ZuluSCSI. The alignment
bracket can be turned 180 degrees and still mount properly.
